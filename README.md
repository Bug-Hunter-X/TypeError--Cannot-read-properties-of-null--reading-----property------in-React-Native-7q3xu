# TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '...property...') in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: attempting to access a property of a null or undefined object.  The example shows how this can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior and provides a solution using optional chaining and null checks.

## Problem

Accessing properties of objects that are currently null or undefined throws a TypeError.  This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous data or complex object structures.

## Solution

The best practice is to use optional chaining (?.) to safely access properties and always check for null or undefined values using conditional statements (if/else) or similar mechanisms.  This prevents unexpected crashes and improves the robustness of your React Native application.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the application in an emulator or on a physical device.
4. Observe the initial error and then see the corrected behavior.
